1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?
* React JS is a component-based JavaScript framework for building interactive user interfaces.

2.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?
* Thinking in React means compartmentalising your user interface into modular components and thinking about the data flow (props) between the components. For example, some components may share props, and so should be wrapped in a common parent component that contains the shared data.

3.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

4.  Describe state.
* A component state is model data that is directly initialised and managed by the component.

* Props are also model data, but they are read only data that is passed from parent components to their children.
